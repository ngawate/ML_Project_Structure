This repository presents a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project, guiding users through every stage of the ML workflow. From data collection and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment, each step is thoughtfully organized to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestiong**  
        Gather raw data from reliable sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
        Clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
        Visualize and analyze data to uncover insights.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
        Create and select meaningful features to improve model performance.

5. **Model Building**  
        Train and tune machine learning models using best practices.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
        Assess model accuracy and robustness with appropriate metrics.

7. **Model Deployment**  
        Deploy the trained model for real-world use.

8. **Monitoring & Maintenance**  
        Continuously monitor model performance and update as needed.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for EDA and prototyping  
- `src/` — Source code for preprocessing, modeling, and utilities  
- `models/` — Saved model files  
- `reports/` — Generated analysis and results

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the notebooks and scripts to reproduce the results or adapt the workflow to your own dataset.

## Folder Structure Workflow

**Src Folder**  
    The `src/` directory contains the following files:
    - `data_ingestion.py`
    - `data_preprocessing.py`
    - `exception.py`
    - `logging.py`
    - `eda.py`
    - `feature_engineering.py`
    - `model_building.py`
    - `model_evaluation.py`
    - `model_deployment.py`
    - `monitoring.pygit`
    - `utils.py`

**Setup.py**  
       All the package buidling material and requirements to use libraries
